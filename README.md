# BMI_Calculator
This code creates a simple web app that calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) based on your height and weight. You can choose between metric or imperial units, and the app will give you your BMI along with a general category, like “Normal” or “Overweight.” No fuss, just quick feedback.
